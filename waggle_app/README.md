## Background
Waggle is an app where pet owners can find sitters they trust to take care of their pets. As an owner of 5 pets and counting, finding someone I trust has always been important when it comes to the care of my fur children. 

## Getting Started
Signup and create your profile! Choose to be a pet owner, a pet sitter, or both! Add your pets, and find a sitter near you!
